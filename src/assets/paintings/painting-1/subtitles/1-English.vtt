00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.100
When he was painting, Soutine had this gift

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.300
of cutting out certain elements of the decor

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.680
to make them unexpected, impromptu, surreal.

4
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.570
In his representation, he chooses to afflict

5
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.280
me with this disproportionate ear, like an

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.800
eminence among my face .

7
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.600
An exhausted face, that perhaps betrays the

8
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.890
hard morning work which falls to me.
