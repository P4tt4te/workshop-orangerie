00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,260
The models painted by Soutine are always

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,770
depicted facing three-quarters of the way,

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,590
most often in a seated position.

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,250
And then, from the 1920s onwards, background

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,770
objects are hardly represented anymore in

6
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,130
favor of a bare surface.

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,680
I am one of the few exceptions.
