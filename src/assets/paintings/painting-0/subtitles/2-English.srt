00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,730
The posture that the painter asked me to

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,650
adopt was perhaps inspired by another

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:08,750
painting by Jean Fouquet: the portrait of

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,730
Charles VII, the latter residing in the

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:11,930
Louvre Museum in Paris.

00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,480
The rag I am holding in my hands stands out

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,010
because of its bright red color, in stark

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,770
contrast to the predominant white of my work

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,290
outfit.
